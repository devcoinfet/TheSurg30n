# TheSurg30n
This is used in Unison with the Bone saw to achieve remote exploitation via an automated manner for fun the bone saw is just a clever name for the metasploit integration piece as the surgeon strikes with such accurate precision I couldn't help myself with the names lol every surgeon needs a bonesaw and scalpel 


this was done for fun I am not a professional pentester nor coder so forgive the shit code

usage is as follows

TheSurg30n.py inputscanfromnamp.xml
